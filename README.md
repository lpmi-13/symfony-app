# Symfony playground

The whole point of this is to get myself familiar with PHP/Symfony/Doctrine. I'll probably try to actually show something from the database, as well as dockerize it and put some metrics around it.

I may or may not get as far as defining some test SLOs, we'll see...

## the plan

To start out with, I'll just be following along with the symfony tutorial here:
